# üìçüìåTodo List App using ReactJSüìçüìå

I have created this app for the purpose of revising my React and Redux concepts. It is a simple todo list where you can add small tasks and keep a track whether they are completed or pending. When you open the application, you have the option to add a new task to list as well as mark the tasks which are complete in the list. The completed tasks will be displayed in a seperate list.

## Usage Guidelines

* For installing the app locally, you need to have NPM installed in your local environment/machine. Once npm is installed, open a terminal or git bash(for Windows) in the project directory and enter : `npm install`
* Once all the NPM packages are installed, you need to run `npm start` for starting the application on localhost on port 3000
* For creating a build for the application, run `npm run build` and new build will be ready. Build version can accessed using the [serve]("https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve") package and on port 5000
* For hosting the application we are using [Firebase Hosting]("https://www.medium.com/@bensigo/hosting-your-react-app-with-firebase-hosting-add1fa08c214#:~:text=%20Hosting%20your%20React%20app%20with%20Firebase%20hosting,will%20be%20deployed%20and%20served%20by...%20More%20")
